<h1>Benchmark MountBlanks: Mounting 3-D Objects&hellip; an overview</h1>

<p>
  Our MountBlanks are designed to help you create custom professional mounts
  using only basic workshop tools. For those of you lucky enough to have
  access to a well-stocked workshop, the MountBlanks can save you valuable
  time by eliminating the soldering step.
</p>
<p>
  We have hammered, sawn, formed, annealed and silver-soldered our brass to
  make the shapes most commonly used. They are available in seven classic
  shapes: T's, spiders, hooks, leverage, bowl, hat and plate mounts. The chart
  below gives you an overview of each type of MountBlank:

        A real workhorse, used to support a wide variety of objects. To
        finish, pad with polyolefin or Teflon heat-shrinkable tubing or spray
        with clear Krylon. Paint-out with acrylic artist's paints to blend in
        with objects or background. Used for either deck or wall
        installations.
      </td>
      <td>
        Used to support objects with more complex display characteristics. The
        3 crossbars enable more possibilities than the 2 arms of the "T". Used
        for either deck or wall situations.
      </td>
      <td>
        Used to stabilize a variety of objects. Very useful when top-heavy
        sculpture (or large footed vases) need to be secured to a deck. Shape
        the strap to the foot of the artifact. Being strap (rather than rod)
        it will have a minimal profile and be less conspicuous. Drill and
        install the rod stem into the deck.
      </td>
      <td>
        This is a pretty wonderful style of mount. Using the opposing forces
        of leverage, this mount takes objects with oval or round shafts and
        angles them effortlessly up from the deck. The upper strap wraps under
        the object, holding its weight; the lower strap wraps up and over the
        object keeping it from falling out of the mount. Pure mountmaking
        magic.

        Three fully annealed arms to cradle the bowl (or bowl shaped
        whatever). A countersunk hole where the three arms meet accepts a
        standard drywall screw with which the mount is secured to the deck.
        Comes in two sizes.

        long brass stem with a pointed end, fitted with a 2" x 3" brass plate.
        Comes with a 4" x 8" x 8" Ethafoam block. You carve the foam to fit
        inside your hat. The whole installs into deck or wall.

          For the Wall:
        </p>
        <p>
          Two bottom tabs (soldered to a center stem ) are shaped to your
          plate's profile and support its weight. There is also a top tab
          that, after being shaped to the plate's profile, slides into a tube
          to lock the plate in place.
        </p>
        <p>
          Comes in three sizes.
        </p>

        <p>
          For the Deck:
        </p>
        <p>
          Two tabs soldered to a curved rod get shaped to plate's profile and
          support its weight. The strap going up the back keeps the plate from
          falling backwards. The tilt backwards keeps the plate from falling
          forwards. The stem is bent to go into the deck.
        </p>

          Comes in three sizes.

        Used to securely cradle round-bottomed objects by shaping to fit that
        roundness, while the mount itself stays put by being screwed into the
        deck. We will sometimes, if appropriate, augment the mount by placing
        a weightbag inside the object.
      </td>
      <td>
        Used to support hats and hat-like objects. Carve the Ethafoam to fit
        inside artifact, stick the foam on the brass stem, and bend the stem
        to the shape you need. Install in either deck or wall.
      </td>
